<h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                Hey guys! I'm a programmer that wants to help others. I code in python, html, javascript, c+, c#, and block coding. I might sound a little mellow, but I can assure you I'm not boring.
                I play baseball, I create websites, I am a animator, I edit videos, and I skatboard. <br>
                I love to watch coding tutorials to help others and with my extra spare time, I read lots of book.
                If you ever need to talk to me, contact me on the links above!
                <p>
